          "A server account is a type of non-human identity (NHI) specifically designed to facilitate the operation and management of server-based applications and services. Unlike user accounts, which are associated with individual human users, server accounts are typically utilized by software applications, services, or automated processes that require access to system resources. These accounts often possess elevated privileges to perform tasks such as running background services, accessing databases, and executing scripts. Server accounts help in maintaining security and ensuring that only authorized applications can interact with sensitive system components. They are commonly configured with specific permissions tailored to their functions, thereby minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. Best practices for managing server accounts include regular password updates, monitoring account activity, and implementing the principle of least privilege, which restricts account permissions to the minimum necessary for functionality.",
          "## Examples",
          "- Database server account used by a web application to interact with the database.\n- Application server account for running a content management system.",
          "## Additional Information",
          "- Server accounts should be regularly audited for security compliance.\n- Use of service accounts can reduce the risk of credential theft in cases of application vulnerabilities.",

          "Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security protocol that enhances the protection of non-human identities (NHIs), such as service accounts, APIs, and IoT devices, by requiring two or more verification methods to access sensitive information or systems. NHIs often operate autonomously and can have significant access permissions, making them appealing targets for cyberattacks. MFA mitigates the risk of unauthorized access by combining different authentication factors, such as something the NHI knows (like a password), something it has (such as a security token or a cryptographic key), or something it is (like biometric data). By implementing MFA for NHIs, organizations can ensure that even if one credential is compromised, the additional verification steps provide an extra layer of security, effectively safeguarding critical infrastructure and data against potential breaches. This approach is essential in today’s cybersecurity landscape, where attacks on NHIs are increasingly common.",
          "## Examples",
          "- Using a password and a security token for API access.\n- Requiring biometric authentication and a digital certificate for IoT device management.",

          "In the context of Non-Human Identities (NHIs), API gateways play a crucial role in facilitating secure and efficient communication between various applications, services, and automated entities that do not require human intervention. NHIs often represent software agents, bots, or IoT devices that need to interact with APIs to perform functions autonomously. API gateways provide a single entry point for these entities, allowing them to access multiple backend services while enforcing security policies, rate limiting, and authentication mechanisms. They can also handle load balancing, caching, and logging, which improve the overall performance and reliability of the system. By abstracting the complexities of interacting with different services, API gateways simplify the integration process for NHIs, enabling them to operate more effectively in distributed environments. This is particularly important in microservices architectures, where numerous services need to communicate seamlessly without direct exposure to each other, enhancing both security and scalability.",

By utilizing service accounts, organizations can improve security and operational efficiency, as these accounts can be managed, monitored, and rotated independently of human users. They often come with unique credentials and are configured for specific purposes, minimizing the risks associated with credential leakage or misuse. In cloud environments, service accounts play a pivotal role in enabling secure interactions between different services and applications, making them a foundational element of modern IT infrastructure.",

          "The principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) is a fundamental concept in cybersecurity, particularly in managing Non-Human Identities (NHIs) such as service accounts, applications, and automated processes. It dictates that these identities should not have more permissions than required for their specific functions. This minimizes the attack surface and reduces the risk of exploitation by limiting what can be accessed or modified by these identities. For instance, if a service account only needs read access to a database, it should not be granted write access or administrative privileges. Implementing Least Privilege involves regularly reviewing permissions, using role-based access control (RBAC), and ensuring that any elevated privileges are temporary and logged. By adhering to this principle, organizations can enhance their security posture, mitigate risks of data breaches, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Overall, the Least Privilege principle is crucial for maintaining a secure environment where NHIs operate with the minimum necessary permissions to reduce vulnerabilities.",

Initially introduced in the early 1990s, NTLM was designed to replace the older LAN Manager (LM) protocol and provides a more secure method of authenticating users. NTLM operates by using a series of hashed passwords and challenge-response mechanisms to verify a user's identity without sending the actual password over the network. While NTLM provides a basic level of security, it has known vulnerabilities, particularly to relay attacks and brute-force cracking. As a result, it is often recommended to use more secure protocols, such as Kerberos, in environments where enhanced security is required. However, NTLM remains in use for backward compatibility with older systems and applications. Understanding NTLM is crucial for managing Non-Human Identities (NHIs) in environments where service accounts or automated processes require authentication, ensuring safe and secure operations.",

This principle is critical in reducing the attack surface and mitigating risks associated with over-privileged access. By implementing least-permissive access, organizations can better protect their data and systems from potential threats stemming from compromised NHIs. For instance, if an automated application only needs to read data from a database, it should not be granted write permissions. This approach not only enhances security but also fosters accountability, as it becomes easier to track the actions of NHIs. As NHIs continue to proliferate in modern IT environments, adhering to the least-permissive access control paradigm is essential for maintaining robust security postures and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.",

NHIs can operate within various digital ecosystems, and their actions can often be monitored through data analytics. Anomalies may indicate potential issues such as security threats, system malfunctions, or unexpected behavior in automated processes. For instance, if a bot typically interacts with users at regular intervals but suddenly starts sending a high volume of messages in a short period, this could be flagged as an anomaly. Effective anomaly detection involves utilizing machine learning algorithms and statistical methods to analyze historical data, establish a baseline of normal behavior, and flag instances that fall outside this baseline. The goal is to ensure the integrity of systems and to take proactive measures against potential risks associated with NHIs.",

This process typically includes changing passwords, API keys, and tokens at defined intervals or after certain events (e.g., suspected breach, personnel changes). Implementing credential rotation helps to ensure that even if credentials are exposed, their usefulness is limited by the rotation schedule. Additionally, automating the rotation process can minimize operational overhead and reduce the potential for human error. Effective credential rotation policies should also include monitoring for credential usage to detect anomalies and ensure compliance with security standards.",

          "## Description",
          "Identity and access management (IAM) is crucial for managing both human and non-human identities (NHIs) within an organization. NHIs refer to automated processes, applications, or devices that require identity verification and access control to operate effectively. IAM systems facilitate the creation, management, and deletion of these identities, ensuring that NHIs can perform their functions securely while minimizing the risk of unauthorized access. In the context of NHIs, IAM encompasses the use of APIs, service accounts, bots, and other automated services that need to authenticate and authorize access to organizational resources. Effective IAM solutions for NHIs include features such as role-based access control (RBAC), policy enforcement, and continuous monitoring of identity activities. By implementing robust IAM practices, organizations can protect sensitive resources, maintain compliance with regulatory requirements, and enhance their overall security posture against various threats.",

          "## Description",
          "IVR-OTP is a secure authentication mechanism that leverages Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology to deliver a One-Time Password (OTP) to users, typically during automated phone calls. This method is especially useful in scenarios involving Non-Human Identities (NHIs), such as automated systems, bots, or applications that require secure access without human intervention. When a system needs to verify its identity or perform a secure transaction, it can initiate an IVR call to the registered phone number of the NHI. The system then generates a unique OTP and conveys it through the IVR system, allowing for secure authentication. This process helps in preventing unauthorized access and ensures that only the legitimate NHI can perform sensitive actions. IVR-OTP is commonly used in banking, financial services, and other sectors where security is paramount, while also being scalable and efficient for automated processes.",
          "## Examples",
          "- A banking bot receives an IVR call with an OTP to authorize a transaction.\n- An automated service provider uses IVR-OTP to verify the identity of a registered system before granting access to sensitive information.",
          "## Additional Information",
          "- IVR-OTP enhances security by providing a time-sensitive password that is valid for a single session only.\n- This method can be integrated with various automated systems to facilitate secure transactions without human interaction.",

          "Second Factor Authentication (SFA) is an essential security mechanism employed to enhance the protection of non-human identities (NHIs), such as service accounts, applications, and bots, which often interact with systems and networks. In this context, SFA adds a layer of security by requiring not only a password (the first factor, something the entity knows) but also a second form of authentication, such as a one-time code sent to a device (the second factor, something the entity has). This approach mitigates the risks associated with compromised passwords, ensuring that even if an attacker gains access to the password of an NHI, they would still need the second factor to access sensitive systems or data. Implementing SFA for NHIs is crucial in environments where automation and integration are prevalent, as it helps to maintain the integrity and security of automated processes while reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access.",

This approach leverages blockchain technology and cryptographic techniques to create self-sovereign identities that can be verified and authenticated by multiple parties in a secure and tamper-proof manner. In the context of NHIs, decentralised identity allows devices or applications to interact with each other and with humans in a trustful environment. For example, an autonomous vehicle can prove its identity to traffic systems and other vehicles, ensuring secure communication and transactions. This not only enhances security but also provides a framework for privacy, as NHIs can selectively disclose information without exposing their entire identity.

The entity itself does not need to authenticate itself to the server, which simplifies the authentication process but may introduce potential security risks. For example, in IoT scenarios, a sensor may send data to a cloud service that verifies the sensor's identity but does not require the sensor to validate the cloud service’s identity.

          "An authentication authority is a critical component in the management of Non-Human Identities (NHIs), which include devices, applications, and services that require identification and access control. In this context, the authentication authority serves as a trusted entity that verifies the identities of these non-human entities before granting them access to systems, networks, or data. It employs various protocols and mechanisms, such as Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or OAuth, to ensure that the NHIs are who they claim to be. This is particularly important in the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), where numerous devices operate autonomously and interact with sensitive information and resources. Effective authentication authorities help prevent unauthorized access and ensure secure communication between NHIs, thereby safeguarding an organization's digital assets. As NHIs proliferate, the role of authentication authorities in managing these identities becomes increasingly critical to maintaining security and trust in automated processes.",

This method acknowledges that NHIs, which often operate autonomously, can be vulnerable to unauthorized access and attacks. By implementing multiple layers of authentication, organizations can ensure that only legitimate NHIs gain access to sensitive information or perform critical operations. For example, an NHI may first authenticate using an API key and then require a time-sensitive token generated by a secure mechanism.

          "Mutual authentication is a crucial security mechanism in the context of Non-Human Identities (NHIs), such as devices, applications, or services that interact without human intervention. In mutual authentication, both the client and the server (or two non-human entities) verify each other's identities before establishing a connection. This process helps to prevent unauthorized access and ensures that both parties are who they claim to be. In the realm of NHIs, this can involve the use of digital certificates, cryptographic keys, or tokens. For example, in the Internet of Things (IoT), a sensor might need to authenticate itself to a cloud service while also verifying that the cloud service is legitimate. This two-way verification enhances security and trust in automated systems, reducing the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks, identity theft, or data breaches. As non-human entities become more prevalent in digital communication, implementing mutual authentication is essential for maintaining secure and reliable interactions.",

          "## Description",
          "In the context of Non-Human Identities (NHIs), abstraction refers to the conceptualization of entities that do not possess human-like traits but are instead defined by their roles, functions, or relationships within a system. This allows us to create models or frameworks that facilitate understanding and interaction with these identities. For instance, an artificial intelligence system can be viewed as a non-human identity that operates based on abstracted algorithms and data processing methods rather than human emotions or consciousness. Abstraction helps in recognizing that NHIs can possess unique identities and functionalities despite lacking human characteristics. It emphasizes the importance of viewing these entities through the lens of their interactions and contributions to larger systems, rather than their human-like attributes. This approach is vital in areas such as robotics, virtual agents, and environmental entities, where the focus is on their operational roles rather than anthropomorphic traits.",
          "## Examples",
          "- An AI chatbot designed for customer service, operating based on scripted responses and learned behaviors.\n- A software agent managing network traffic, functioning autonomously without human intervention.",
          "## Additional Information",
          "- Abstraction allows for the creation of standardized interfaces for interacting with NHIs.\n- It aids in the development of ethical frameworks that consider the unique identities and impacts of NHIs.",
